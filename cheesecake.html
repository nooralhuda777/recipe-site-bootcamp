    <p>Ingredients</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Graham Cracker Crust 1 and 1/2 cups (180g) graham cracker crumbs (about
        12 full sheet graham crackers)
      </li>
      <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>5 Tablespoons (71g) unsalted butter, melted Cheesecake</li>
      <li>
        32 ounces (904g) full-fat brick cream cheese, softened to room
        temperature
      </li>
      <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup (240g) full-fat sour cream, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice (optional, but recommended)</li>
      <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <ol>
     <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to
      350°F (177°C).</li>  
      <li>Make the crust: If you’re starting out with full graham crackers, use a food processor or blender to grind them into fine crumbs.</li>

      <li>Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar until combined, and then stir in
      the melted butter. Mixture will be sandy. Try to smash/break up any large
      chunks. </li>
     <li>Pour into an ungreased 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. With
      medium pressure using your hand, pat the crumbs down into the bottom and
      partly up the sides to make a compact crust. Do not pack down with heavy
      force because that makes the crust too hard. Simply pat down until the
      mixture is no longer crumby/crumbly and you can use the flat bottom of a
      small measuring cup to help smooth it all out if needed. </li> 
     <li>Pre-bake for 10
      minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of
      aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in
      step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.</li>  
      <li>Make the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment,
      beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed
      in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes.
      Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully
      combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each
      addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the
      batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and
      cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can. You
      will have close to 6 cups of batter. </li>
      <li>Prepare the simple water bath (see
      note): If needed for extra visuals, see my How to Make a Cheesecake Water
      Bath; the visual guide will assist you in this step. Boil a pot of water.
      You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, so make
      sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. As the water is
      heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Place the
      pan inside of a large roasting pan. </li>
      <li>Pour the cheesecake batter on top of
      the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer.
      Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or
      you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water
      in. Whichever is easier for you.) Bake cheesecake for 55–70 minutes or
      until the center is almost set. If you notice the cheesecake browning too
      quickly on top, tent it with aluminum foil halfway through baking. When
      it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently
      shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly. </li>
      <li>Let the
      cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour.
      Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely
      uncovered at room temperature. Then cover and refrigerate the cheesecake
      for at least 4 hours or overnight. Use a knife to loosen the chilled
      cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then remove the rim. Using
      a clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe
      the knife clean and dip into warm water between each slice. Serve
      cheesecake with desired toppings (see Note). Cover and store leftover
      cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
